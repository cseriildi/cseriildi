# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am a mathematician, who is currently working as a Data Analyst. I am interested in Machine Learning, and I am looking for a Data Scientist opportunity. Although I am new in this field, but I consider myself a curious person and a fast learner and I can easily adapt to new environments thus I can quickly become a useful part of the team.
